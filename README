This repository contains a static multi-page website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is structured to provide a clean, user-friendly interface while covering the essential sections commonly found in web applications, such as Home, Categories, Suppliers, Announcements, and About pages. In addition, it also includes Login and Signup forms to simulate authentication flows, making it a strong foundation for building more advanced full-stack applications in the future.

The site is primarily front-end focused and designed for educational/demo purposes or as a prototype. The authentication pages (Login/Signup) are currently UI-only and do not include backend logic for storing or validating credentials. However, the modular structure of the project makes it straightforward to connect these forms to an API or backend service later.

🔹 Pages Overview

Home (index.html) – Landing page that introduces the project and serves as a navigation hub to other sections.

Categories (category.html) – Displays different categories of content/products, suitable for showcasing grouped items.

Suppliers (suppliers.html) – Highlights suppliers or partners with details such as names, descriptions, or links.

Announcements (announcement.html) – A page for publishing updates, events, or news bulletins.

About (about.html) – Contains background information, project purpose, mission, and credits.

Login & Signup (login.html & signup.html) – Provide the user interface for authentication. At present, they validate inputs only on the client side and do not store or process credentials.

🎨 Styling

The project uses a modular CSS approach to keep styling maintainable:

style.css contains global styles applied across the entire site (typography, layout, colors, header/footer, reusable components).

signup.css provides page-specific overrides tailored for the signup form’s design and responsiveness.

🧠 JavaScript

The script.js file handles front-end interactions such as:

Navigation controls (menu toggling, smooth scrolling, etc.)

Basic form validation for login/signup fields

Dynamic UI effects for enhancing user experience

This script can be expanded to include features like local storage handling, category filters, or fetching external API data.

🗂️ Assets

All images and icons are placed inside the Images/ directory to keep the structure clean and organized.

⚙️ Development & Setup

Since this is a static site, it can be opened directly in a browser via index.html. For development convenience, the repository includes a package.json file, allowing you to set up a local development server or run npm scripts if desired. Common tools like http-server or serve can be used to host it locally.

🚀 Deployment

The site can be deployed easily on any static hosting service such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. No build step is required—deployment only involves serving the static HTML, CSS, JS, and assets.

🔒 Security Note

While login and signup pages are included, they are front-end only. For production use, a secure backend must be integrated to handle:

Proper authentication (sessions, JWT, OAuth, etc.)

Password hashing and secure storage

Input sanitization and validation

HTTPS for encrypted communication

🛣️ Roadmap for Future Enhancements

Connect login/signup forms to a backend API for real authentication

Add database or API-driven announcements

Implement search and filtering for categories/suppliers

Add supplier detail pages with richer content

Introduce dark mode with persistent theme toggle

Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, color contrast, keyboard navigation)

Optimize SEO with meta tags, structured data, and sitemaps

👉 In short, this repository is a well-structured starting point for a full web application, currently serving as a static prototype but designed in a way that makes it easy to scale into a dynamic, production-ready project with backend integration.
